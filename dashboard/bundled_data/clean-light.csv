For this question, the value of the R&D assets your business produces should be allocated to owners (or future/final owners). The total expenditure allocated to the owners should equal the sum of the in-house expenditure as reported in question 11. This is a new concept and it may be difficult to identify who the owners are, so please provide your best estimates. It may be necessary to consider individual R&D projects and aggregate the results if possible. | If the R&D performed in the reporting period is (or is expected to eventually be) subject to intellectual property protection (such as patents and copyrights), the holder of that protection is the owner. For example, if the R&D your business performed in the reporting period is covered by patents owned by your UK business, the full in-house expenditure should be entered into question 14a. | If the R&D results are made freely available for others to use, this should be allocated to question 14m. | If a number of organisations will own the R&D assets, the in-house expenditure should be divided and allocated to the relevant owners: - If contractual arrangements exist which determine ownership in percentage terms, for example, 60% owned by your UK business and 40% owned by the UK Government, please use these percentages to divide the in-house R&D expenditure between questions 14a and 14b. - If no contractual arrangements exist, the value of the assets should be divided according to your best estimate of their use. For example, if your business and another organisation are both owners, but your business will make more use of the assets, ownership should be allocated accordingly. If the use of the assets cannot be estimated, the assets should be divided equally between the owners, or allocated to the lead organisation as appropriate. - If all the R&D you perform is fully funded externally, then please allocate the owner of the in-house expenditure to the relevant question categories that reflect the funders. ||| Dynamic - User can fill in one or many columns within the matrix","in-house R&D which is developed and published and made freely available for others to use.
