For example, if your business and another organisation are both owners, but your business will make more use of the assets, ownership should be allocated accordingly. If the use of the assets cannot be estimated, the assets should be divided equally between the owners, or allocated to the lead organisation as appropriate. - If all the R&D you perform is fully funded externally, then please allocate the owner of the in-house expenditure to the relevant question categories that reflect the funders. ||| Dynamic - User can fill in one or many columns within the matrix","Questionnaire for defined-benefit schemes","Deal with all investment items by reference to the date of contract rather than the payment or receipt of funds.
